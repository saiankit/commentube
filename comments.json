I hope you read this as this could be an interesting addition to this particular video.",

I've been trying 1 mm microneedling for 4 weeks now (without minoxidil). As I understood, just one treatment alone will not bring the dead zones back to healthy ones. What is about cycling minoxidil for example every 2nd day in combination with weekly microneedling? After some time when the zone gets reanimated - just once a week or less and less until no minoxidil is needed anymore.\nI think this is really crucial for the majority of people especially men, who do not want to be dependent on meds for their entire life.",

That was 18m ago, I have managed to regrow my hair and it‚Äôs now growing back far thicker than before. Here‚Äôs what worked for me - raw liver every day, high dose ( 3 to 4gms) of flush niacin daily (I mix it with equimolar) l glutamine & 3000mcg of folic acid. I ate a ton more meat and eggs and took both marine and bovine collagen, I also started making raw milk kefir, drank bone broth. I used rosemary on my scalp - boiled up rosemary from the garden, sieved it and put it in a spray bottle and used it on my scalp daily. Cut back washing to once a week, and did a scalp treatment with rosemary essential oil every time. Stopped blowdrying my hair as much as possible (only if I was going somewhere I needed to look super groomed). And finally I said positive affirmations about my hair on my daily walk eg my hair is growing thick and strong, there are no impediments to my hairs growth, my hair is my crowning glory. It all worked together to regrow my hair to a condition where it‚Äôs now way better at 50 than it was at 30. Good luck to all of you suffering with hair loss, it‚Äôs v stressful particularly for women.",

I ask this question because in one of the Q&A's you mentioned massaging the scalp would create a small oxytocin release. I used to feel this when I would get a haircut. Then AMSR became more known about and aspects of quiet talk and such stimulate the same sort of feelings. Is AMSR related to oxytocin release or something else?",

God's gift to hair. \nMany studies have shown that rosemary is MORE effective at blocking DHT than minoxidil! \nYou can use Rosemary essential oil by directly massaging it into your scalp for thick and healthy hair. You can also steep rosemary sprigs in boiling water until the water is infused with the medicinal properties from the sprigs. Throw it in a spray bottle and away you go! I prefer this as my hair is already prone to being a little oily, and this is a great alternative. \n\n*Hot tip - you can freeze the rosemary water in ice cube trays & thaw them as needed. Spraying your entire head is a great way to end a shower. Plus your hair will smell great!",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. Also daily consuming bone broth (great for collagen) 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

I do believe diet plays a big roll, my diet was something I changed drastically in the last year, lost 80 lbs. I drink a collagen drink every single night. I did a combination of all of that, biotin supplements and a biotin shampoo and conditioner which I reviewed and shared before and after. I got a bit of hair back but then it just stopped and its been maintained since. I stopped using the bioltin shampoo to see if it would have an effect after quitting but so far no change, I use a tea tree shampoo threse days since I just like the feel of it. The last time I went and got my haircut a few months ago they tried to sell me on some rogaine type stuff that was really expensive, told them where they can put it.  I got some decent feedback going bald so that could very well still be what I decide to do in the end, easier to manage lol.",

No shampoo, some little brushing every day, etc. The yoga thing or hair masks are not daily, just some days. It's great to see that in just two months the scalp starts creating it's own microbiome, the same way the gut microbiome when you take probiotics, you become healthier overall.",

    "text": "Hi Dr. Huberman, as usual, great episode. You've covered so much in these 2 hours that can really save somebody from years of research and misleading information. As someone who has delved into research on stopping androgenic alopecia, I would like to add some points that I think everyone watching would have some benefit from. If any of you happens to read this comment, please leave a thumbs up so that more people can see this and hopefully learn something new. \n- Dermapen and similar devices are a better option than dermarollers because of the way the needles puncture your scalp\n- Tretinoin applied topically can increase minoxidils efficacy by upregulating follicular sulfotransferase enzymes\n- Both microneedling and tretinoin can make you a responder to topical minoxidil or decrease the application from 2x to 1x per day to achieve the same or greater results (even though 1x per day is sufficent for most people due to minoxidils halflife)\n- Topical caffeine should be used in dosages not greater than 0.2% (some studies used 0.005% solutions with success), greater dosages could potentially do more harm than good\n- Topical finasteride solution of 0.025% reduces serum DHT levels by 24.4% (compared to ~70% reduction from 1mg of oral) - I think that you've mentioned this in your episode with Kyle Gillet\n- Topical dutasteride can lower systemic DHT even lower due to being a bigger molecule, thus going less systemic, and having a lower half-life at low dosage\n- Topical anti-androgens can also be used to avoid inhibiting 5-AR but they can carry their own set of side effects\nNow, I would also like to point some things that really caught my attention that hopefully you'll understand as a way to promote a healthy debate and further improve our understanding of androgenic alopecia:\n- This is the first time I hear someone mention increased prolactin due to topical minoxidil usage, although it makes sense, I think that most people should not be worried about this and that it is a fairly safe treatment option, and that you exaggerated the side effects of minoxidil a bit.\n- While you were harsh on minoxidil, you proposed saw palmettto as a fairly benign option, which in my opinion should be regarded as a weak 5-AR inhibitor and thus contain the same side effect profile as finasteride and dutasteride (although with lower prevalence due to it's lower strength).\n- Dutasteride is used by men that can't achieve the desired effect of finasteride because of their sensitivity to androgens (as you've mentioned 90% of people achieve the effect using finasteride), so it can be a bit misleading to say that they start using it only because of it's ability to provide faster results.\n- Some side effects of 5-AR inhibitors start early on in the treatment and disappear after a week or two, while others experience them further on it the treatment and have to wait a longer time for them to dissipate (which can resemble post finasteride syndrome).\nI would like to conclude this comment with a request for you Dr. Huberman to further investigate the 5-ARs function in producing neurosteroids (which could also be a potential cause of the post finasteride syndrome). As someone who is interested in neuroscience and psychology, I would really love to see your review of the literature on this topic and a potential mentioning of this topic in a further hair/hair loss prevention video. Also a video on neck, and neck training would be awesome, haha.\nThank you for your podcast and your contribution to society.\nA big fan of yours,\nPhil",

    "text": "The cause of my hair fall problem was finally identified: using the incorrect shampoo. Most individuals, including myself, only search for shampoos that are free of parabens and sulfates. However, there are many other toxic chemicals present in shampoos that can contribute to hair fall, such as formaldehyde, PEG, EDTA, phthalates, silicones, fragrances, colors, MEA, TEA, and Quaternium15. Continued use of these chemicals can cause notable issues, such as scalp buildup, dandruff, dryness, and reduced hair strength over an extended period. After extensive research, I found a natural shampoo that is entirely free of these harmful chemicals and began using 100% natural hair oil. As a result, my hair fall has stopped, and I've even noticed the emergence of new baby hairs on the right side of my scalp.\nMy consistent experimentation and education have given me the ability to confidently read any product label and easily differentiate between good and bad beauty products.",

Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits.

While AA affects only 2% of the general population (7 million in the US), it has been making great gains recently and finally has an FDA approved drug called Baricitinib for treatment. At the forefront of the research and trials is Dr. Brett King of Yale University, who would make a great guest (he breaks down the biology in an easy to understand way and has a very assessable style, similar to you Andrew). As a mother of a now adult daughter with AA who lost her hair in middle school, we tried many of the techniques and supplements you mention in this episode to no avail.

I‚Äôve also heard women going on birth control pills and then having a permanent increase in breast size. I myself have had a permanent decrease in breast size after getting off the pill, which I was only on for a month anyway. And I have no idea how to get my size back. Granted it was only a little bit of a difference and no one can tell. But I would love an episode on hormones and breast growth, and different methods that might have some impact on breast growth. For example Fenugreek causes an increase in size but it is temporary I believe.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. Also daily consuming bone broth (great for collagen) 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

    "text": "Andrew, I came across some research that indicated that the pattern of male pattern baldness is consistent with the pressure points on the scalp due to head growth/shape. If you've noticed, people with abnormally large heads have hair loss, and vice versa, people with smaller heads (specifically the top of their heads, tend to have very good hairlines. Its theorized that excess head size causes a low oxygen environment that exacerbates the proliferation of the anabolic effects of DHT, more specifically the bones growth effects, which can lead to things line calcium depots along with other debris, and thus becomes a cycle leading to hair loss. The way i look at it, something along these lines loads the gun, and DHT pulls the trigger. Remove one and you slow/stop hairloss.\n\n I know this seems like psuedoscinece, but i just refuse to believe that the hair on the top of our head is just \"more sensitive to DHT\" and therefore goes bald. The original theory is not even proven and lacks logic in totality, and i feel it is missing something. I Started exercises where i loosen the scalp with aggressive massages and acid peels to clear dead skin, calcium deposits, and other debris to free up the hair follicles, so DHT has less of an impact and ive pretty much stopped my hair loss since 2015, Now, if i did go the route of minox, micro needling, and dht blockers, i would without a doubt see crazy regrowth, i just don't want to be hooked to these drugs with side effects. \n\nWhat do you think of ths theory?",

Long story short, it has been 6 years and I still deal with the effects of post finasteride syndrome. I have shrunken genitals, ED problems, lack of pleasure from sex among many other symptoms. I have received nearly no useful treatment from medical providers. There is more research going into it as we speak, but it has completely upended my life in what should have been some of my best years. I will never get my time back. I am glad to see PFS getting more and more recognition, particularly with services such as Him's becoming more popular and more and more men speaking up. Thanks Andrew.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

Sure, your might cure your diffuse thinning due to stress or allergy with your remedies but not androgenic alopecia. It's like saying \"eat eggs to increase height\" when both parents are 5'3\". Andrew talks about these products because they are most common form of treatment for most common reason of hairloss. Plus, he is 'that hormone guy on youtube'. Who else would talk about these things than him?",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

That's when I went to a  dermatologists. They there is nothing much that can be done to the 'dead area' and that nothing will grow back there as it is 'scarred' and it is an autoimmune condition.  My symptoms don't seem to be the same as others I have encountered - I am not itchy or red or sweaty and I do not have any other autoimmune conditions.

    "text": "So, a healthy lifestyle means dropping all the garbage they try to sell you. As for hair loss, just accept it and own it. If it helps, just remember all the famous or happy people that are bald. Instead of worrying about hair loss, focus on mental health and don't allow it to become a complex. Shift your focus on what really matters, which is a happy life, and as I noted earlier, a healthy lifestyle. Balance in life is key for anything, really.",

    "text": "This was a masterclass of knowledge, and I would like to add a few things based on my own journey. Feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.\n\n1. It was my understanding that topical finasteride leads to lower side effects due to less systemic absorption when comparing 1mg orally vs 1 mg topically daily.\n\n2. It seems like Dutasteride, when applied topically, not only reduces more scalp dht than finasteride but also has less systemic absorption. Apparently, this is explained by its molecule structure.\n\n3. When choosing minoxidil, it has been shown that Retinoic acid can boost results significantly. In other words, it will lead to better outcomes to apply 5% minoxidil + Retinoic Acid than using 10% minoxidil.\n\n4. Literature says that to optimise results, micro-needling should be performed no more than once every one or two weeks. Recovery time is necessary for scalp healing.\n\n5. Nizoral shampoo leads to better results when left for 10 minutes sitting on the scalp. 3-5 minutes seems like insufficient time to penetrate the scalp effectively.\n\n6. Scalp massage, when performed twice daily (for 15 minutes each session), leads to significant hair growth, though there is still a lack of robust evidence. It seems like scalp elasticity it‚Äôs also a factor for hair loss (have you seen that every bald guy has a shiny and tense scalp?)\n\n7. It‚Äôs possible to get a topical solution that includes everything: caffeine, minoxidil, finasteride, etc., for example, through minoxidilmax.com\n\n8. Finally, there is a lot of misleading information, and I think the best place that I have found so far to learn and be guided by someone with vast experience is perfecthairhealth.com (better than a regular doctor, in my opinion)\n\nI hope this may be useful for someone. Happy to reply to comments.",

To prescribe a potent hormone disrupter to a young man that can wreak havoc on the brain and body is inexcusable.  Androgen receptors are located all over the brain and body.  Chemical castration and death of masculine drive.  Perfect example of how the current biomedical pharma system preys on people who are vulnerable, anxious and in this case, likely experiencing mild body dysmorphia.  It doesn't help that bald men are by and large unrepresented in popular culture.  Thank you for emphasizing informed consent in your lecture.\nShow less",

    "text": "Hi Andrew, great podcast! I am a finastride user. My Dr recommended I start of with 1.25mg  dose. I did that for about 3 months, didn't feel like it was doing anything so I uppped my dose to 2.5mg everyday and started to experience some minor headaches. I then lowered it to 2.5 every other day. That seemed like a good sweet spot. I started to notice thickening of hair/growth and less hair scattered around my place. As you said after awhile it starts to taper off and to me it seemed like it was regressing so I upped my dose slowly. I have adjusted the dosage a couple or few times, and now I'm at 5mg/day with no side effects. \n\nWhat worries me is that you kept emphasizing the 5mg dosage, as though its a really high dose, and secondly I feel that within a year or two I will probably see the effects taper off again, if not regress. Is going higher than 5mg a serious concern, or is it safe as long as I experience no side effects? \n\nSadly you seem to have a more elaborate understanding of the drug than my Dr, so I'm hoping you can help alleviate some of my concerns\n\n\nCheers!",

About 6 months ago I had a large mental health crisis which eventually led to me stating I wanted to kill myself and had a series of large mental blow ups before that. Never in my life have I struggled with mental health and at that time my family wanted to take me to a mental health facility. I was going through relationship problems at the time, and have since felt much better with a different partner but I don't know if the finasteride contributed or worsened my mental health crisis. If anyone else has had serious mental health problems while on finasteride I would love to connect.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

After two weeks on I will check my prolactin levels again while still abstaining from porn and masturbating.\n\nIf it comes back high after dropping back low, while using the control as abstinence to match my last test results of lower prolactin, I will know for sure minoxidil is the culprit in my elevated prolactin.\n\nDon't be fooled though, chronic (even meaning 1x daily porn and masturbating) can lead to higher prolactin levels.\n\nThis is why many men will feel substantially better when the don't jerk off or watch porn. \n\nAnyways check back with me in 2.5 weeks and I will have the verdict on my little case control antidotal study ü§£",

No discussion of Telogen Effluvium, macro or micro nutrient disorders, gut disorders that can lead to malnutrition and hair loss, stress, cortisol, TNF-A and Interleukin etc. This just parrots the commonly held belief that DHT is responsible for all 'male pattern balding' due in large part to faulty logic.\n\nThere is no evidence that DHT 'rises as we get older' thus is makes no sense that DHT would be the most important factor in hair loss.  IMO Inflammation and damage to the body over time via poor diet, stress, heavy metal toxicity etc are far more likely to be the primary factors in hair loss for most people.  Not that DHT doesn't play some role, but it seem to be dramatically up-played because Big Pharma has drugs they can sell you to lower it.  Not exactly good medical science.  Definitely expected more here.",

    "text": "Love your show, and love how you address different populations each time.  However, I did feel like this one left out information about specific issues faced by women during their lifecycle.  Here are a few that I was hoping to understand when I saw the subject:\n\n1) post-partum hair loss.  Is it permanent or transient? Is there a way to mitigate or reduce?  A lot of ‚Äúold wives‚Äù remedies here including being told to not stop prenatals and you will avoid the hair loss‚Ä¶ is this true or is it simply hormone based? \n\n2) post-menopause hair growth in undesired areas.  Any way around this?\n\n3) does shaving really thicken hair?  Most women are told to wax and not shave facial hair or it will grow thicker‚Ä¶ some women swear by this others say it‚Äôs just a myth.  Is it? Does it make a difference if you use depilatory cream vs razor?\n\n4) is hair dye a risk factor for hair loss in anyway?  Many women have been dying their hair since the first signs of grey in their 20‚Äôs.  Does that aggravate hair color or hair loss?\n\n5) are there any supplements or behaviors shown to maintain color longer as opposed to just hair growth?",

We don‚Äôt get a lot of publicity despite our growing patient base (in the thousands to tens of thousands) and debilitating symptoms. There have been some recent studies, funded by patients and their families/friends, through the pfs network which demonstrate some epigenetic mechanisms behind the condition. One of the current leading theories is androgen receptor gene overexpression, leading to downstream dysregulation of thousands of other genes, as demonstrated by Howell et Al., 2021, at Baylor. More coverage of this disease and the recent science behind would be really informative and would be a godsend for the PFS community!",

I was going through a ton of hair loss a few years ago and did a lot of research through @moreplatesmoredates channel. I've since seen a ton of regrowth and overall feeling so much more in control about the loss of hair. I highly recommend trying the stack of anti hairloss Andrew recommended but more than just a physical benefit you really do get such a big mental sigh of relief when you start to see progress. There is a stigma of talking about hair loss especially for younger males so this is such a great guide.",

Then I made a critical error: I stopped taking it. It‚Äôs been 10 years now, & my baldness frequently leads to people thinking I am 10+ years older than I actually am. My advice to all of the young balders out there is to learn from my mistake. Once you notice any changes, get evaluated & get on treatment. If I had stuck with it, I probably would‚Äôve slowed the loss significantly or maybe even put everything on pause if I were lucky.",

It could mean mass of drug/mass of solvent, mass of drug/total mass, volume of drug/volume of solvent, volume of drug/total volume, mole fraction of drug, molar ratio between drug and solvent. Each one of these fractions (when expressed as a percentage) will have a different value, and in some cases this value can be quite high. The most descriptive and easy to understand concentration measure is mg per mL.",

    "text": "This was a good podcast on the science. I have had hair loss twice. I used to have high density curls which is now low density. My loss was likely a combination of haircare practice, stress, pregnancies, nutritional deficiencies plus predisposed from both parents having pattern hair loss and type II diabetes. Hair loss is very complex in women and the pattern of loss is not the same as men. Not all women have hair that falls out in a pattern - I definitely didn't and my hair loss doesn't resemble either of my parents or my maternal grandmother.  My paternal grandmother definitely went down in density but post menopause. I have seen women lose their hair from PCOS, Thyroid, Pregnancies, Nutrition, Birth control - come on/going off and immune system.  Gut health and stress do play a part and should be addressed.  I have managed to improve my density (it's never going to be how it was) and my hair quality back without going down the medication route but know that menopause could cause this to all go!  I have found reducing stress, fixing my diet, exercising, getting good quality sleep and doing some of the mechanical aspect - Red light and massage have worked for me. Could I try the medication - sure but honestly at this point I don't think it's going to add anymore hair and I don't want to commit to lifelong treatment. Haircare should go hand in hand with treatment.  Many people are not using the right shampoos or conditioners for their hair - not washing or conditioning appropriately - don't use commercials as an example! Also hard water, the environment and processing hair (dyeing/chemical treatments) all impact hair quality. If you want to maintain your hair you should work with both a medical professional on the treatment for hair loss and a licensed hairdresser/barber on caring appropriately for that hair.",

Hims is ass and they offer like 3% which is higher than the standard oral dosage of 1mg.\n\nAnd if you listened to the podcast you will know that topical goes systemic the same as oral at higher doses.\n\nI bet if this guy used a reasonable dose of topical finasteride (.005%-.001%) he would most likely not see side effects.\n\n.005% is equivalent to .05 mg of finasteride and .001% is equivalent to .01mg of finasteride which is literally impossible to take oral due to how the pills would turn to dust trying to cut to that small of a dose.\n\nTo put this in perspective .001% topically would equate to around 1mg spread out to a 30 day period.",

    "text": "Dr. Huberman and fellow bro-scientists, \n\nI was about to buy a derma roller and lotions when I realized I've heard of all the effects you've mentioned in this podcast. It's called a stinging nettle and my backyard is always full of it. Not only are they mechanically the same (stringing hairs on the nettle are shorter than 1 millimeter, and for hair growth you don't need to micro-needle further than 1/4mm), but the chemical properties are similar when it comes to blood flow and inflammation, and even more surprising is that medicinally it has similar effects as FINESTERIDE. Although I never tried it myself, and often joked about doing so when doing yardwork, people in my neck of the woods have been making teas, and ointments from stinging nettles for centuries.\n\nWe're now in April, and these nettles will continue to fester for at least 5 to 6 months. What I'm proposing is‚Äîbecause I'm not allergic, don't try this bros‚ÄîI'm gonna put on some safety glasses, and whack myself on the scalp every 2-3 days for the next 6 months and rub in some nettle. Not so much for science, but because it's funny and I like a bargain.\n\nWill keep you guys updated.",

I have read about this topic because of a friend who required help on this. When I saw the title of this video, my first thoughts were Nizoral, Ketoconazole, Minoxidil and the article about the scalp massage. That time I spent one or two days just reading articles, researching literature and trying to see to the bottom of this endless topic. It is funny to see that I could partly find articles to the resources, methods and supplements using the platforms and methods we used at our university. Being able to read and understand science is such an enormous help, I wish more people would have the access to do so. Thank you for enabling this to a wider audience.",

I‚Äôm not super masculine, but I have around 20% body fat and I‚Äôm not insulin resistant because of my healthy diet.\r\n3.\tMy diet focuses on micronutrients, not macros. I have this app called Cronometer, and I eat in a way that according to this app, I can cover 90 plus percent of my micronutrients every day. I don‚Äôt pay attention to macros and calories at all. \r\n4.\tI also eat fermented foods every day. Kefir, Kimchi, fermented cabbage, stuff like that. I make them myself in salt and water only. Store bought ones have zero active culture.\r\n5.\tI take only two supplements, cod liver oil and magnesium.\r\n6.\tI‚Äôve been also taking Citalopram 20 for a few years now.

    "text": "Thank you so much for this podcast!\n\nMinoxidil topical goes as LOTION or FOAM, and the magic behind Minoxidil is that it will go systemic at a much lower % compared to oral one.\n\nMinoxidil topical half-life is 22h, and that's why it's used once a day; however, for men, we noticed that twice is best because it keeps the concentration well above 50% during the whole 24h period.\n\nThis is why Minoxidil lotion or foam is considered OTC by FDA.\n\nThe exact mechanism of action is NOT known, and it has 3 possible ways: increase blood flow, increase fenestration, or creation of NEW ATP Potassium Channel Openers.\n\nMinoxidil oral is prescription only, and the reason for that is because of its systemic side effects.\n\nMinoxidil topical side effects categorize into two: skin-related and drug-related.\nSkin-related: irritation, itchiness, dandruff, or redness - all these are caused by the recipe that the company you buy the product from creates its formulation. (often times relates to PG - Propylene Glycol)\nDrug-related: it's because of a sensitivity to this specific medication, and you can do nothing. (0.4% of total users will encounter these: swelling, weight gain, and increased heart rate)\n\nI hope that this extra info helps.\nWith respect, Tudor. @thehairlossdude\n\nP.S. I must mention that my opinion is biased, because we sell minoxidil lotion bundled with different other products and programs. So I kindly ask you to check my comment and come with contra arguments.",

    "text": "Hi Dr Huberman! Thank you for the episode. As a med student this knowledge is unparalleled. The episode was extensive, yet l would like to add a few things just that people can do their own research. 1) Topical progesterone could be a potent DHT blocker. USP grade progesterone cream could be a potent hair loss treatment. 2) Fenugreek spray could be another potential DHT blocker topically used. 3) Grains have a lot of proteins aside from well-known gluten that can cause systemic inflammation, trying  grain-free diet for a period of time could be an option. A plethora of methods are available to reduce low-grade inflammation which may translate to decreased hair loss. Time-restricted eating being one of the better ones. 4) PRP-treatment will provide growth factors to the recipient area that will likely increase hair growth. Puncturing the skin in PRP is not the primary method of action.  5) Nanoxidil has a smaller molecular size and is claimed to be more efficient than common minoxidil, so the vasodilation could be more profound. 6)  Soft-tissue calsification of the scalp could be a hair loss factor. Vitamin K2 supplementation can alleviate the issue.   Thanks again l know you are going to read my obnoxiously long message and l definitely do not expect you to answer, yet somebody can benefit from these shared pieces of knowledge.",

Finasteride plus bio-identical progesterone capsules were life savers for my sleep and my hair! I don‚Äôt recommend progesterone cream for perimenopause! But bio identical progesterone is helpful.\nFinasteride actually slightly increases estrogen in females. It only works if you have high DHT because it works by blocking DHT in the scalp. I had high DHT..Most males have high DHT..which can affect hair on the scalp. I had high DHT.\nAs for males, they can use Finasteride topically and it worked for my husband without side effects.",

    "text": "I wish that you would do an episode about Corsetry and and waist training.. I do it in a healthy way alongside aerial yoga and belly dancing... All three seem to complement each other.. While there are an enormous amount of health benefits women can receive and men to for that matter, by doing waist training exercises, or possibly wearing a girdle or waist cincher, (do you see what i did there) it is a huge fad right now to wear shapewear, (shapewear is trending)this is great as long as nobody's breaking ribs, and how far is too far like the Brazilian but lift !? I have no intention of going and having invasive surgery when I can just exercise and diet and maintain a good physique but it's not that easy for some women.. just thought I would bring that up it would be an excellent podcast to listen to... And maybe keep a few people from making some bad decisions they will have to live with the rest of their lives.... For instance the fake plastic surgeon in dallas who was giving Black market cosmetic surgeries.. using ingredients as horrid as gorilla glue as filler but these young girls fell  for her scams and left with horrible side effects..",

    "text": "Interestingly, if you stop taking pramipexole,(Mirapex)  a dopamine agonist,  you can get what is called Dopamine Agonist Withdrawal Syndrome.  Pramipexole is a Parkinson's drug also used for RLS.  It's also actually a great antidepressant (and has been noted to compulsive gambling, sexual behavior, etc.) until it leaves you with DAWS. The main symptom is devastating depression. In DAWS there is NO treatment yet for the condition.  It can last forever.   I'm not even sure restarting the medication helps.   I'm not a doctor, just someone who has experience with DAWS.  But if there is no treatment for Finasteride syndrome, you are playing with destroying your quality of life.   Is it worth it?  An aside: Titrate any drug you discontinue.  Slowly.  Very slowly.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

The side effect talk was specifically something I wasn‚Äôt aware of. As far as how it‚Äôs been working, around 20 years old I saw signs of hair loss (thin hair up top, and hairline a bit widow‚Äôs peaky), and started taking care of it consuming said items, and while I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve noticed a huge change as far as hair regrowth, although some of the people around me said they did, it hasn‚Äôt gotten any worse since the signs first appeared. Also worth noting that my brother at 25 was near balding without any treatment, wheareas I, with the treatment, still have a lot of hair. I don‚Äôt really know if my relatively full head of hair is because of how I‚Äôve taken care of it, or if I wouldn‚Äôt have lost my hair regardless, but I still do it just in case. Would love to hear anyone else‚Äôs experience.",

    "text": "Finasteride messed up my MEMORY so badly that I will make this comment before I even watch the episode. BEWARE.\n\nThis was circa 2010. Google and hair loss forums at the time were basically repeating ad nauseam that other than transplants and novel treatment options, the big 3 were minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride. Minoxidil reputedly had lower efficacy and seemed a chore to apply all night every night. Durasteride was not FDA approved for hair loss and still somewhat novel itself. Naturally finasteride seemed the responsible approach. And I consulted Google, hair loss forums, Merck, my doctor, and my pharmacist about it. All that any of them highlighted to me to watch out for was libido side effects \"in ~2% of men\" and that were I to experience this, that it should subside \"within 2 weeks\" of stopping finasteride \"as it didn't have a long half-life\".\n\nWell, I didn't experience any libido effects. Instead, slowly, perniciously, it made my memory so bad that I one day realized I could no longer even remember what I had for lunch. And the worst thing about a foggy brain is it can't troubleshoot itself. Like a person with Alzheimer's not knowing they have Alzheimer's. Couple that with the fact that you usually take longer to notice issues no one told you to be on guard for. Much like you personally probably didn't notice your hair thinning until you'd thinned a fair amount. It took me ultimately a year to notice my memory had become Swiss cheese. Took fights with my girlfriend where she had insisted she told me something, and I, insisting I had always had a good memory, insisted she hadn't.\n\nWhen I finally clued in and started Googling \"finasteride memory loss\", I finally saw a bunch of forums, that had never showed up during my initial search for \"finasteride side effects\", where a great many people were discussing the memory loss and brain fog finasteride caused them and coping with it. Some reported recovering fairly quickly after stopping finasteride, some reported still having terrible memory years later.\n\nI quit that garbage instantly. I think it took ~6 months for me personally to see any memory improvements. And a decade hence, having adopted a bunch of systems like writing things down, repeating to myself things I want to remember, etc, my memory is back to okay. But I still can't remember what I had last meal half the time.\n\n(To be sure, because don't think I hadn't asked myself this: I have never in my life done drugs, I don't drink, I was not on any other medication, I was not on a single other vitamin or supplement at the time, ate clean, drank solely water and green tea, slept perfectly well, and I did not have any other health issues, or a history of health issues. ALL I had changed leading up to that memory failure was I got on finasteride. If I recall correctly, recommended dose was 1mg and I took 0.5-1mg.)\n\nYour mind, your very person, is worth more than your hair. Believe me. Watch the f‚Äî out. üôè",

    "text": "Just a share of my personal experience.\n\nDue to multiple factors in my life, stress, and depression, my hair started thinning when I was 25. The hairline on the sides started pulling back a lot, and I've been seeing constant falloff while showering.\n\nNow when I'm 30, 7 months ago, I decided to do something about it, and my dermatologist prescribed me two things:\n1. MERZ pills for skin and hair (google the ingredients) - first 3 months one pill in the morning one in the evening.\n2. Minoxidil 5% spray application - two times per day (morning, evening).\n\nI've been persistent and the results after 6 months are more than surprising.  Hair thinning is stopped completely, and I can see loads of thin baby hair growing in receding areas.\nMy hair is noticeably thicker ( not as it used to be but an improvement nevertheless) and now when I wash my hair, I can barely notice any fallen hair.\n\nSeeing results, I will give up on hair transplant, since my anxiety regarding my hair is gone, and my motivation is up.\n\nHopefully, this will help somebody reading the comment section, never give up!",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

It‚Äôs akin to how tooth loss was deemed unavoidable for thousands of years, but yet it was completely eradicated in your lifetime by those using good hygiene.  Same principles for keeping your hair.\n\nA friend adopted it and stopped losing his hair.\n\nIf you have time, I can share it with you.  Would love your feedback.",

I don't really notice any negative side effects from anything I've taken. Currently taking dutasteride, 2.5 mg oral minoxidil, and nizoral shampoo every 3 or so days (sitting on my scalp about 15 minutes before rinsing. I haven't really noticed any regrowth but it does seem like I'm losing hair at a slower rate. I was also using liquid minoxidil with RU58841 mixed in and actually saw a fair amount of regrowth with that but it's such a pain to mix the solution every night and apply. I would miss too many days so I stopped but may go back to it in the future. Try microneedling with the derminator 2 but felt like it was doing more harm than good, especially at 1-1.5mm. Might go back to this as well with less needle depth, maybe 0.5mm.",

    "text": "Dr. Huberman, reports of negative side effects from finasteride often exclude the mental distress caused by hair loss to begin with. When an individual does not know how to account for the trauma, anxiety or the body dysmorphia that is likely to develop at the onset of discovering patterned baldness, it is likely that an individual starting in a distressed position will lead them to perpetuating those same negative emotions over a long period of time. I think a lot of the focus on administering this medication has to be the discussion of personal trade-offs. While some side effects for finasteride may be real, the same could be true for individuals who continue to experience hair loss and suffer from a lack of self esteem and other real consequences.",

I've researched this topic extensively, and it was cool to hear that most of my learnings followed what you discussed. \n\nHowever, one new substance called Procelinyl by Revelahealth out of Harvard exists. I've been using their serum for about 2 months, but it's too early to report anything- but they claim their serum to be more effective than minoxidil. \n\nI've been using 5% minoxidil for about 3 years and on 1mg of finasteride for almost half that time. It has slowed/stopped my MPB. Interesting to hear about the topical forms of finasteride- I'll have to look into switching. I didn't know they existed (maybe not in Canada). \n\nI hope we learn more about post-finasteride syndrome and ways of combating or overcoming it in the future. Indeed a risk that I'm sure many didn't know about.",

Supposedly, topical dutasteride, due to its molecular weight, is considered to not enter the bloodstream but should theoretically impact hairloss by inhibiting topical DHT. I am currently on this regime (just barely started a few weeks ago) and I am going to get some follow up bloodwork in a few weeks. I would like to see more research on this topic though because there is not a lot of science around it at the moment.",

Derek from MPMD talks about this in a video years ago and it is like I previously said what the physician recommended to me at the clinic to prevent any ‚Äúpost finasteride syndrome‚Äù or any other side effects. They said that the possibility of it going systemic is there but is incredibly low but I was wondering your opinion on that Dr. Huberman if you‚Äôve heard anything about it. Great video btw!",

My hunch is that since it has some vasoconstriction effects, it would negatively impact your hair. Does it impact other related hormones? Thank you again so so much",

Maybe spending 5-20 minutes upside down each day or even just letting our heads gently hang off a mattress while deeply breathing to try and encourage blood flow to our scalps. Are there any studies studying the efficacy of that methodology? I‚Äôve always wondered if it could work.\n\nFirst time commenter, several week listener. Your work has made an absolutely massive difference in my life in just a matter of weeks. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so very much, Andrew.",

    "text": "what if there is a mechanical issue at play that underlies the androgen receptors of the scalp? What if, as posed by another scientist, we lose a layer of fat in the scalp as the mechanical reason for hair loss? Considering androgen receptors promote growth earlier in life, why would they all of a sudden do the opposite? Perhaps the increase of DHT at the hair follicles on the head are the body‚Äôs last ditch effort in maintaining as much hair as possible because of another underlying condition be at mechanical or otherwise. ‚Ä¶ but again, nobody really cares about solving this for men.

    "text": "So much to take in here. Thanks for laying it all out so effectively but despite your best efforts I'll never absorb it all in a single viewing.\n\n I was on finasteride for about 6 months 1mg daily and by the end I was having issues with sexual function and libido which have gone away almost completely. I would like to try the topical treatment and combine it with the minoxidil I'm already using and also introduce topical caffeine and micro needling. I am currently on aplixaban for a blood disorder and just want to know if you are aware of this could have an impact on my efforts to regrow hair? I appreciate your advice will include the inevitable consult with your doctor and of course I will.\n\nAs a side query, I wanted to ask about blood flow stimulation to the scalp and wondered if the likes of viagra could play some role. I know it has uses in other areas than the obvious such as to help prevent altitude sickness by dialating capillaries and increasing oxygen flow to your extremities. My understanding is that it doesn't necessarily cause you to have a raging hard on and that you'd have to be in the mood for such things. Do you feel that there is any pro/con to considering including it in hair restoration efforts?",

This is why I think you would find his stories intereting, because he has the working experiance of lots of addictions (such as computer games, social media, porn etc) and also meditation and how it helps his patients. \nHope you consider him being on your show, or you being a guest on his",

IE: what's difference in these receptors? 2.)With hair loss (on the head), is DHT actually elevated or is the individual just more sensitive to it via more receptors? Thanks in advance - Marie",

I only got an increased libido and therefore more motivation and overall energy (very classic with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitior). But unfortunately what you read online is mostly fear mongering (crybabies giving themselves a nocebo effect after reading too much about \" bad stories \").\n\nThe reality is the following :\n\nThe side effects on finasteride or dutasteride is extremely rare (less than 2%) and if you get side effects : those go away naturally after about 6 months with continued use of the drug (just the time your body adjust to the drug). So even if you are unlucky : with continued use = you should be fina after about 6 months.  We have scientific data about this.\n\nConclusion : Finasteride and dutasteride are extremely effective to stop hairloss + those are very safe drugs.",

If you‚Äôve been dealing with hair loss for any amount of time, you probably know about the various treatments out there and the potential side effects. The reason this continues to be a discussion is because hardly anybody is satisfied with those options. Either maintenance or potential side effects will lead you to stop or not even start. People are looking for a real solution, not another pontification. If he had an answer or really knew how to address this issue once and for all, then this video would be no more than a minute long. All this leaves you with is an array of options with uncertain roads, and putting you back to where you started, choosing none of them.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

You've got some women even getting their Breast implants paid for by the system citing it helps their mental health. You want to go the mental health route, look at how much Alopecia of any form, including pattern baldness affects mental health, its a unanimous resounding yes that the general public are opposed to losing their hair if given the choice. \nIts an absolute crime how much laser therapy centers want to charge for a procedure that may or may not work, often offering no peer reviews, not giving information about the machine etc. Its not a cosmetic procedure as it directly affects mental health.",

Btw micro needling also promotes collagen production that helps hair to regrow. \nThe best bang for your buck is to get a good micro needling device like the Derminator 2 while taking a low dose of oral Minoxidil (1Mg) with topical Finasteride. And possibly use the iRestore Low Laser Light Therapy helmet, as this also promotes blood flow and hair regrowth.",

If done correctly it indeed will brake up scar tissue in skin, also promotes collagen production and hair regrowth. In point of fact Micro needling alone will promote hair regrowth albeit not as well without the addition of minoxidil. This is achieved by damaging  the dermal papilla, or the stem cells in your hair follicles.\n\n Also as for you misreading what I wrote, I was obviously referring to the amount of oral Minoxidil (1Mg) not the (Topical Finasteride) amounts.",

    "text": "‚Äã¬†@NYC Vegan¬†I was informed by a reputable hair transplant surgeon who said he often encounters patients with scar tissue formation resulting from microneedling performed too aggressively. While there can certainly be benefits to microneedling on a healthy scalp (without any underlying skin condition that makes the scalp more susceptible to scarring), it's essential to acknowledge the potential risk of scarring if the procedure is not performed correctly. In my opinion, the risk of scarring outweighs the benefits. However, I wish you the best of luck in your journey!",

    "text": "My notes:\n\nHair, including its biology and how to slow or reverse hair loss. It dispels myths about balding and hair replacement, and is separate from the host's teaching and research roles. \n  *Introduction to the Huberman Lab podcast\n  *Discussion on science and science-based tools for everyday life\n  *The topic of hair and its fascination from a cellular biology and stem cell perspective\n  *The host's background as a neurobiology and ophthalmology professor at Stanford School of Medicine\n  *Various ways science has taught us to slow or reverse hair loss\n  *Different durations of hair growth on different parts of the body\n  *Every hair has its own stem cell niche in the follicle\n  *Factors determining the length of a hair and what regulates stem cells\n  *Mechanical, chemical, and hormone-related approaches to halting and reversing hair loss\n  *Dispelling common myths about balding and hair replacement\nThe section covers the benefits of Ketone IQ supplement and Roca eyeglasses, and explores the biology and psychology of hair loss. Some key points are:\n  *Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones, providing benefits even if one is not following a ketogenic diet.\n  *Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed to compensate for the visual system's challenges and offer an extensive range of styles.\n  *Hair loss can lead to anxiety and depression in many people, and psychological well-being can impact hair growth and coloration.\n  *Hair loss is a common problem, with about 50% of people experiencing significant hair loss by age 50, leading many to invest in halting or reversing it.\n  *Hair loss occurs between ages 30 and 50 and becomes noticeable only by age 50.\nThe section discusses how our psychological states can impact hair growth and loss, the biology of hair growth, stem cells, and the different components that contribute to hair growth. The transcript also highlights the mechanical and chemical approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss.\n  *People may notice hair thinning in a particular location when bright light permeates the outer boundary of their hair.\n  *Psychological states can impact hair growth and loss.\n  *The podcast will discuss how hair normally grows, why it grows at a certain rate, and why hair loss and graying can impact psychological state.\n  *The podcast will cover both mechanical and chemical approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss.\n  *Hormones like estrogen, thyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor, testosterone, and its derivatives are involved in regulating hair growth.\n  *Stem cells are cells that give rise to other cells and are present in all of us from the very beginning of life.\n  *Every hair on the head or surface of the body is there because of a stem cell population.\n  *The hair root is below the skin and has a little cave or pocket at the base of the root.\n  *The hair shaft is the part that grows out above the skin.\n  *Different components contribute to hair growth, and tapping into these can help halt hair loss or replace lost hairs.\nThis section discusses the structure of hair and its various components, including stem cells, keratin, and sebum. It also covers the erector pili muscle and its function in causing hairs to stand up. The section emphasizes the importance of sebum in both waterproofing the skin and protecting against infection.\n  *There are populations of cells that have the ability to divide via mitosis and give rise to other cells, including progenitor cells and stem cells.\n  *Daughter cells become the various types of cells that make up hair, which is made of keratin proteins stacked on top of each other.\n  *The hair bulb, located in a pocket below the skin, contains not only stem cells, but also cells that give rise to the pigment of the hair called melanin.\n  *Sebum is a substance produced by sebaceous glands next to hair roots that waterproofs the skin and acts as an antibacterial and antimicrobial agent.\n  *The erector pili muscle lies diagonally between the hair bulb and the skin's surface and contracts when we get cold or scared, causing the hairs to stand up.\n  *The erector pili muscle also creates dimples between the hairs that can trap air and warm our bodies.\n  *Sebum is important in protecting against infection and plays a role in psoriasis and hair loss.\nThis section discusses the physiology of hair growth and why blood flow is important for hair growth. It also explains the three phases of hair growth and how hair grows from the bottom up. Additionally, it explains the importance of stem cells, melanocytes, sebum, and erector pili muscles for hair growth.\n  *Hair growth is a robust aspect of physiology, and dogs like huskies can remain warm in the snow due to their hair.\n  *Hairs trap air beneath them and create a blanket-like effect to keep the body warm.\n  *Hair has several components such as the hair shaft, root portion, bulb region, stem cells, and pigmenting cells.\n  *Capillaries provide nutrients, oxygen, and other essentials to the stem cells and melanocytes that support hair growth.\n  *Hair growth is an active process that requires oxygen, nutrients, and blood flow.\n  *Treatments that increase blood flow to the scalp can slow hair loss and extend hair growth duration.\n  *Manipulations that increase blood flow to the scalp, such as scalp massage, are designed to be done in conjunction with other hair growth treatments.\n  *Stem cells, melanocytes, sebum, and erector pili muscles are important components for hair growth.\n  *Hair growth occurs in three phases: the antigen phase, catagen phase, and telogen phase.\n  *Hair grows from the bottom up and extends out across the top of the skin during the antigen phase.\nThe transcript explains the three phases of the hair growth cycle - antigen, catagen, and telogen. The duration of these phases varies depending on the body region and person. The hair growth rate does not differ within a given body region. During the telogen phase, the stem cell population and melanocytes recede, leading to hair loss. However, some hairs can re-enter the growth cycle if there are sufficient stem cells, oxygen, and blood support.\n  *Different hairs on the body have different growth phases and durations. For instance, the hairs on the scalp can grow for two to eight years, while the hairs on the eyebrows grow for a few months.\n  *The rate of hair growth is not something that varies within a given body region. Differences in hair growth are primarily due to variations in the duration of the antigen and catagen phases between individuals.\n  *The catagen phase is a breakdown phase where the hair recedes from the bulb region up towards the skin surface. Its duration also varies depending on the body region.\n  *The telogen phase is a resting phase during which no new hair proteins are being added. The stem cell population and melanocytes recede during this phase, leading to hair loss.\n  *The duration of the three phases makes up the hair growth cycle. Some hairs can re-enter the growth cycle if there are sufficient stem cells, oxygen, and blood support.\nThe section explains the importance of blood flow in hair growth and introduces minoxidil as a treatment for hair loss. It also touches on dosages and potential side effects of the drug.\n  *Blood flow is critical for hair growth as it delivers nutrients and oxygen to the hair follicles.\n  *Minoxidil is a drug originally developed to treat hypertension but is now used to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to the scalp.\n  *Minoxidil extends the antigen phase of hair growth, making it longer and slowing down hair loss.\n  *Minoxidil dosages can be tricky to determine, and physicians will often start with a low dose and gradually increase it to avoid side effects.",

As men, we are expected to quietly internalize such things whilst maintaining an heir of indifference or be seen as ‚Äúweak‚Äù even by a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù society. Unless, of course, you decide to transition in which case you‚Äôll have all the help, solutions and interpersonal support you need possibly even subsidized by insurance üëçüèº",

    "text": "Part 2\nMinoxidil, also known as Rogaine, can cause side effects like headaches, dizziness, and increases in the hormone prolactin. Dopamine and prolactin are antagonistic, so increases in prolactin can cause a decrease in libido, feelings of apathy, and gynecomastia in men. Women may experience swelling and edema of the tissues. Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the stem cell niche below the hair. It can be taken orally or applied topically, with dosage ranges varying greatly. Finding the correct dosage is important to avoid unwanted side effects.\n  *Headaches and dizziness are possible side effects of using Rogaine, also known as minoxidil.\n  *Minoxidil can increase the hormone prolactin, which is antagonistic to dopamine and can cause a decrease in libido, feelings of apathy, and gynecomastia in men.\n  *Women may experience swelling and edema of the tissues when using minoxidil.\n  *Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the stem cell niche below the hair.\n  *Minoxidil can be taken orally or applied topically, with dosage ranges varying greatly.\n  *Finding the correct dosage is important to avoid unwanted side effects.\n  *Dosages of minoxidil can range from 0.25 milligrams to five milligrams per day when taken orally.\n  *Topical minoxidil typically comes in a five percent concentration and should be left on the scalp for three to five minutes to be absorbed into the hair follicles.\n  *Increases in blood flow around the clock is how minoxidil works to stimulate hair growth.\nThe transcript discusses the importance of increasing blood flow to the hair stem cell niche to maintain hair, slow hair loss, or even regrow hair. It mentions using low-dose tadalafil as a way to increase blood flow. The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections to encourage nutrient delivery to the scalp is also discussed, although there is insufficient clinical data to support it as a treatment. The transcript cautions against confusing PRP with stem cell injections and notes that the success of PRP injections may be independent of the platelets.\n  *It's important to increase blood flow to the hair stem cell niche to maintain hair, slow hair loss, or even regrow hair.\n  *Low-dose tadalafil is being used to increase blood flow to the scalp and maintain hair.\n  *Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are being used to encourage nutrient delivery to the scalp, but there is insufficient clinical data to support it as a treatment.\n  *PRP injections are not stem cell injections and may work for reasons independent of the platelets.\nMicroneedling is a procedure that uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries on the scalp, which stimulates hair growth. It has been shown to reactivate stem cells and is an effective augment for hormone-based hair regrowth tools. Low levels of inflammation caused by microneedling or PRP injections can cause changes in cells, stimulating growth. Needle lengths of 1mm to 2.5mm seem to be more effective than shorter lengths. Microneedling shows positive benefits in both men and women regardless of age when used in combination with other treatments.\n  *Microneedling stimulates hair growth by creating micro-injuries on the scalp.\n  *The procedure reactivates semi-quiescent populations of stem cells in the telogen phase.\n  *Microneedling is an effective augment for hormone-based hair regrowth tools.\n  *Low levels of inflammation caused by microneedling or PRP injections can cause changes in cells, stimulating growth.\n  *Needle lengths of 1mm to 2.5mm seem to be more effective than shorter lengths.\n  *Microneedling shows positive benefits in both men and women regardless of age when used in combination with other treatments.\n  *A systematic review found that microneedling has some positive benefits.\n  *The micro part of microneedling is extremely important.\n  *Microneedling causes physical disruption, bleeding, and inflammation to the scalp, which is part of the process that improves hair growth.",

The combination of microneedling and minoxidil treatment is more effective in recovering Dead zones compared to treatments alone. Minoxidil treatment likely needs to be done for life if one wants to hold on to hair growth. Element is an electrolyte drink that contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. \n  *Understanding the cosmetic implications of bleeding and damage to the follicle\n  *Combination of microneedling and minoxidil treatment is more effective in recovering Dead zones\n  *Minoxidil treatment likely needs to be done for life if one wants to hold on to hair growth\n  *Botox is being used to try and offset hair loss by decreasing the tensile nature of the scalp skin so that more blood flow can arrive at that stem cell follicle area\n  *Botox treatment to the scalp is becoming pretty common but should be done by someone skilled\n  *Botox eventually wears off\n  *Element is an electrolyte drink that contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium\nThe section discusses the use of Botox injections for hair loss treatment and the chemical factors that affect hair growth. Key points include:\n  *Botox injections can reduce scalp tension and improve hair growth, but repeated injections are necessary for efficacy.\n  *There are few clinical studies on the use of Botox for hair loss, but it appears to be a safe alternative to minoxidil.\n  *Cuttis verticus gyrata is a scalp condition that is associated with hair loss and can be treated with Botox injections.\n  *Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and cyclic AMP are key factors that accelerate hair growth by extending the antigen phase.\n  *Phosphodiesterase (PDE) and TGF beta 2 are factors that act as brakes on hair growth by shortening the antigen phase or extending the catagen phase.\n  *Androgen-related alopecia, induced by testosterone and its derivatives, is the most common cause of hair loss in both men and women.\n  *Testosterone levels decline with age, but older men can still have similar levels to younger men.\n  *Women have higher levels of testosterone than estrogen, but lower levels than most men.\nThe section discusses the relationship between dihydrotestosterone, androgen receptors, and hair loss. It explains why people lose hair in certain regions and the genetics behind it. It also explores the use of caffeine as a treatment for hair loss.\n  *Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibits hair growth by reducing igf-1 and cyclic amp.\n  *Testosterone is converted to DHT by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.\n  *Pattern hair loss is Androgen dependent alopecia.\n  *The pattern of Androgen receptors on the scalp differs among individuals, and it is inherited from the mother's side.\n  *Androgen receptors on the face stimulate beard growth.\n  *Caffeine is a potent PDE inhibitor, which indirectly stimulates igf-1, and can suppress hair loss and stimulate hair growth.\n  *Topical caffeine application can be as effective as minoxidil application in treating hair loss.\nThe section discusses the use of topical caffeine ointments as a potential treatment for hair loss. Caffeine is shown to stimulate hair growth and prevent hair loss by reducing cell death in stem cell niches. Oral caffeine intake is not effective in stimulating hair growth due to limited concentration in the scalp. Prescription drugs like growth hormone and sermorelin can also increase hair growth, but they have side effects.\n  *Topical caffeine ointments are a potential treatment for hair loss\n  *Caffeine stimulates hair growth and prevents hair loss\n  *Oral caffeine intake is not effective for stimulating hair growth\n  *Prescription drugs like growth hormone and sermorelin can increase hair growth\n  *Growth hormone and sermorelin have side effects\nThe section discusses how certain treatments can increase hair growth and skin health, but they come with risks such as increased cancer risk. Insulin sensitivity and iron levels also play a role in hair growth. Dihydrotestosterone can shorten the hair growth phase and miniaturize hair follicles, but reducing 5-alpha reductase can prevent this. There are supplements and prescription treatments available to improve insulin sensitivity and iron levels.\n  *Certain treatments can increase hair growth and improve skin health.\n  *These treatments can also increase the risk of cancer.\n  *Insulin sensitivity is important for maintaining hair growth.\n  *Iron and ferritin levels are also key for hair growth.\n  *Dihydrotestosterone shortens the hair growth phase and miniaturizes hair follicles.\n  *Reducing 5-alpha reductase can prevent the negative effects of dihydrotestosterone.\n  *Supplements and prescription treatments can improve insulin sensitivity and iron levels.\nThe section discusses the use of Saw Palmetto and Ketoconazole to offset hair loss and stimulate hair growth. Saw Palmetto inhibits 5-alpha reductase weakly and is known to have few side effects. Taking 300mg of Saw Palmetto per day can help maintain hair growth. The effectiveness of herbal compounds for hair growth is difficult to prove due to the many variables involved. Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal that was initially developed to treat dandruff and psoriasis. It can increase hair number and diameter despite its common side effect of drying and thinning hair.\n  *Saw Palmetto inhibits 5-alpha reductase weakly and is known to have few side effects.\n  *Taking 300mg of Saw Palmetto per day can help maintain hair growth.\n  *The effectiveness of herbal compounds for hair growth is difficult to prove due to the many variables involved.\n  *Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal that was initially developed to treat dandruff and psoriasis.\n  *It can increase hair number and diameter despite its common side effect of drying and thinning hair.\n  *The mechanism of action for Ketoconazole is through the inhibition of the sebaceous gland and the production of sebum.\n  *Saw Palmetto and Ketoconazole are potential standalone treatments for hair loss and can stimulate hair growth.\n  *Herbal compounds and plant-derived compounds for increasing hair growth are often taken in combination, making it difficult to prove their effectiveness.\n  *Taking 300mg of Saw Palmetto per day divided into two or three doses is recommended.",

Unfortunately AFAIK there are no clinical studies studying minoxidil for beard growth, but there's communities of people (minoxbeards on reddit for instance) that share anecdotal experiences. In my case the difference is very clear and I definitely can grow facial hair in areas where I 100% couldn't beforehand. And that's in my mid-30s, so it's unlikely that it's coincidence, given the age and the speed of change. It would be great to have actual science and studies backing this treatment, but for now we depend on anecdotes.",

I have switched to nicotine gums but occasionally I relapse. You have talked about benefits of nicotine if taken through patches or gums. You even mention a Nobel laureate who chews nicotine gums. On the other hand I see research articles citing long term side effects of nicotine on health and other aspects  especially fertility. Most of the research has been on nicotine taken via smoking. I would be great if you could declutter the issue in detail.\nThanks for your work.\nLove from India.",

    "text": "Chronology some comments because they doesn‚Äôt seem right to me:\n1. There is no DHT receptor; all Androgens and estrogens can bound to it. People with high duasteride do have hairloss while DHT are zero when taking DHEA. If at all, it‚Äôs a ‚Äûreceptor‚Äú which has a broad range.\n2. Hairloss starts after puberty, not after 30 or somewhat. It‚Äôs just depends how fast you you lose hair to notice, and noticing itself is of course subjectively. \n3. I dont know any male who has not hairloss especially under stressed times (in military literally everybody has hairloss) but since we were shaved a lot didn‚Äôt notice until others told them\n4. Hairloss, especially mpb, is not only a hair problem, it‚Äôs a skin problem primary. I think it‚Äôs a way too far to talk about stem cells. When the skin is inflammed hair loss will occur. \n5. it‚Äôs true that Sebum is anti bacterial, but sebum is a paradise for Fungi, it‚Äôs btw a huge missing part in the whole hairloss topic because fungi do inflame skin, and it‚Äôs possible explanation for acne too. Therefore androgens role can be understand better because no androgen=no sebum=no fungi=no hairloss/Acne. Keep just in mind.\n6. I‚Äôm not the opinion that blood flow is not the solution alone, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the solution for mpb. Since i do breathing exercises my hair is perfect, thats carbon dioxide, vasodilating. It‚Äôs like minoxidil without side effects. \n7. It‚Äôs hilarious because He describes perfectly that the Anagen phase is anabolic and so on, but the whole hair hemisphere dismis the fact that adrogens are anabolic and Cortisol is catabolic. Every biologist should know that androgens and Cortisol compete for the ‚Äûreceptor‚Äú but androgens are the blame instead of Cortisol. Just think about it‚Ä¶ and references to ‚Äûdon‚Äôt stress because your hair will fall out‚Ä¶‚Äú\n8. NO, DHT does not cause Hairloss, there is no evidence for that. Myself used DHT right to my hair and my hair grew thicker and stronger, but no regrow, whatsoever no additional hairloss. The same was done to mice, DHT increases hair density. Sorry Prof but that claim isn‚Äôt scientifically back up, it‚Äôs at best a hypothesis which lays there for more than 70 years and brought us nowhere. Dislike\n9. Everywhere in the Body eher Eid a state of hypoxia(no oxygen) the is in increase in DHT because 5AR needs oxygen. Again, no support for the DHT Hypothesis.\n10. Minoxidil turns on NO, and Nitric Oxide makes vasodilation possible, but doesn‚Äôt turn it on necessarily (fe no carbon dioxide=no vasodilation)\n11. Microneedling he also another Factor: it allows the skin to heal better because in most cases the area without hair is fibrotic (scar tissue) and when there is scar tissue no hair will grow. It‚Äôs often dismiss that even if you would completely cure the root cause of your hairloss the fibrotic tissue wouldn‚Äôt allow to regrow hair. So removing the fibrosis is essential to regrow hair. Btw: why is the tissue fibrotic in the First place and bald people has this shiny head liked polish? That‚Äôs inflammation. I hope you have some lightbulb moments here and there\n12. the Botox aspect‚Äôs kinda proves that even breathing exercises will help hairloss. Botox relaxes the muscle around the head, probably stress restrict due to tense muscle the blood flow. Stay üòé\n13. it‚Äôs interesting because IGF-1 is increased trough androgens‚Ä¶ but androgens again are the blame. Androgens makes most, maybe all hair, grow expect for the upper part of the head. The hypothesis is üí© \n14. TGF Beta 2 is increased everywhere where is inflammation‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not exclusive to hair loss, and that‚Äôs the another reason why the whole DHT hypothesis is false.\n15. NO, the so called ‚Äûandrogentic ankleckert doesn‚Äôt start at 50 or so, it‚Äôs starts right after puberty‚Äú\nNo, it‚Äôs not true 1:09:59\n\n16. 1:12:58 Ah, so older people, for whatever reason have higher enzyme activity but doesn‚Äôt experience all the insanely good effect of DHT the Prof just mentioned earlier (high Libido, strength etc etc) ??? I think people should latest start here to asked more questions because obviously here is something wrong. For my personal, I say that with age carbon dioxide and oxygen do work less efficiently and when there no oxygen than 5AR is active in tissue where the hypoxia is located. Obviously it‚Äôs not systemic in term like ‚Äûyou got older and 5AR is now higher so you have hairloss etc). Btw Baby‚Äôs habe mpb in most cases Prof. It‚Äôs a huge missing point and at least my View purely false to say so how you did (with needed respect to talk like that, I like Huberman Lab)\n1:14:15 \nProbably not. It‚Äôs well documented that the areas with no hair/hair loss have less blow flow, and so less oxygen and so logically more DHT because of disturbed enzyme activity.  Saying it‚Äôs the androgen receptor while is actually quit proven that the areas are in hypoxic state doesn‚Äôt sound logically to me, probably because it‚Äôs kinda stupid.\n\n1:25:03 \nWhat I miss is, that there is only a talk about insulin effectiveness, but rarely the talk is about insulin itself. Skinny guys, low weight people, people on diets etc have lower insulin due to lack of carbohydrates, and this mimics features of diabetes. It doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to talk about insulin resistance when there is no insulin in the first place. That was off topic, but worthy to mention.\n\n1:27:44 Evidence?\n1:28:01 Evidence?\n1:39:07  No‚Ä¶.\nFinasteride is created in Frankenstein manner from progesterone‚Ä¶\n1:45:20 \nYes, it‚Äôs horrific. Pharma still sells 1mg tablets of Finasteride, but 0.1mg is is much safer and same effective. Pharma again is hanging in the last century.",

The Question should be ‚Äûwhy medications like Finasteride or duasteride work?‚Äú fin and Duasteride are 5AR Inhibitors, but they also change Hormone pathways. I never saw a man growing all his Hair back even on higher Dosis of Duasteride (their DHT wasn detectable). It want you to understand that a medication that blocks a specific enzymes doesn‚Äôt prove at all that the blocked enzyme was fault in the first place because medication have a broad range of action. Finasteride was introduced to help with prostate, gaining some hair was a noticed side effect of Finasteride. I hope you understand what I mean",

    "text": "Hi, for whoever is suffering : iron deficiency causes hair loss. Especially for women with PCOS, get a blood test to check your iron levels. Anything lower than <80 might be exacerbating hair loss. Iron is stored int he hair. So when you are deficient, the body suppresses the hair from pulling it from your body and storing in the hair. It is a SIMPLE SOLUTION. It will take at least 2 to 3 months of taking iron to increase levels in your body until you see results, but take the first step and get that blood test! I hope this helps anyone who needs it. I feel you, and your anxiety about it. You are beautiful now and things will get better. üå∏",

I don't do highlights anymore, and products make a difference.  I spent a lot of time and money finding the right ones for me. I think my hair is doing ok for now, so I'm thankful for the progress I've been able to make.",

    "text": "Most young men especially are not psychologically prepared for the effect hair loss has on the brain. The perception of the aging process at a quickened pace early on can become a very high stress event especially during their prime in the mating game. Less so if one understands evolutionary psychology and ways to offset it. Current times with the popularity of sports like MMA help make it less an issue with so many shaving their heads or keeping it closely cropped. Best approach is to be well rounded in your personal attributes and don't over focus too much on any one area. In fact use other areas to offset any deficiencies. What has not changed is the marketing that feeds off of personal insecurities be it hair loss, weight loss, etc. Stay aware of how it all works and don't worry about the hair loss if you suffer from it. Worry about getting better in other areas of your life. \n\nThousands and thousand have been permanently harmed by Finasteride along with those who chose the hair transplant route which comes down to math. If the math does not add up neither will the result. You can never lose 50% of your hair and then expect to restore it with the 50% that is left. Stay informed. \n\nBottom line hair loss for men becomes a threat to their ability to pass on their genes at the sub conscious level. Suggested reading \"Evolutionary Psychology\" David Buss. Once you understand it then it becomes easier to work around it all. Thanks for the video.",

The particles invade lymph nodes first, then liver and finally on to other organs.  Models indicate that nano particles cross the blood brain barrier.  Indications for liver dysfunction within 10 years of tattooing are already evident.  Would be a great subject especially since Huberman is heavily tattooed.",

    "text": "Till this Day, there is no Evidence that DHT causes hairloss. Physicians has brought this from only 2 Papers as a derivation (James B. Hamilton (1954) and Julianne Imperato-Mcginley (1974). It‚Äôs all based on the ‚Äûlogic‚Äú that castrates never developed male pattern baldness (Hamilton) and the finding that pseudo Hermaphrodites (McGingley) lacking 5-AR also never develop mpb, and since Finasteride was already in the market, it was easy to sell it for hair loss too since I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt need expensive permit, whatsoever Gaining some extra hair is just a side effect of Finasteride, it doesn‚Äôt explain anything how and why men get hairloss, especially so much more in the newer generations. Of course I can‚Äôt expect that Prof. Huberman (greetings from East Europe üòÅ) does know everything and can dig that deep, but it‚Äôs insanely important to show that the data is crap and taking Finasteride is probably very dangerous and the long run (the same is probably true for minoxidil because it inhances iNOs, it‚Äôs like chemotherapy without having cancer). It would be even more happy when Prof Huberman would be more critical to science based things when the outcome obviously isn‚Äôt effective.  I hope I dont sound bad or strange, not native speaker, I‚Äôm calm nice dude üôè",

Consciousness can only stem from consciousness itself (Allah the most Exalted). According to all scriptures (especially Quran) There are two faculties of cognition that influence consciousness: Brain and Heart(soul). Adolf Hitler had a sharp brain (expert analyst of empirical data and making associations between it). However, his cognition of heart was completely impaired therefore he was blinded from spiritual data and therefore all mercy, love and light of Allah (one/indivisible God).

These days the only thing that belongs to me in the shower is bar soap. \nI'll admit something I think is kinda funny. Back when I had hair I had really long hair and I treated myself to this really nice brush/comb set thing. Aluminum handles, etc... SO NICE! 21 when I first started shaving my head lets not forget, I didn't finally throw the brush set away till I was 32. 11 years after shaving my head and 2 years after I finished lasering off all my hair. I just couldn't get myself to throw them away they were just so nice. I would have loved to give them to someone but really?? Can you see it, hey bro, want some really nice brushes and combs... they're used but still in good condition. LOL\nSeriously though, I HIGHLY recommend laser hair removal. Baby smooth everyday with zero maintenance.",

    "text": "‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã¬†@Namikaze Omar¬† I would say that's a great idea . Also keep in mind that finasteride gets its \" best result \" at month 24 so 2 years after starting . Which means you results could come up later.\n\nAnd also keep in mind that \" keeping what you have \" in terms of hair count is already a win for finasteride users . My point is : don't expect regrowth from finasteride. Cause maintenance is what's going to happen with finasteride (your main goal is to stop the hairloss, not to regrow what you lost).\n\nHowever, if you feel like you are not maintaining your ground on finasteride then i would definitely add both topical minoxidil 5%  (apply once a day, it's enough) and dutasteride twice a week on top of finasteride for another year. If you still lose ground in 1 year ? Then I would completely switch over to dutasteride 0.5mg everyday while using topical minoxidil 5% as well. \n\nHope it helps üôè. \n\nPs : you might actually get some regrowth with dutasteride everyday + minoxidil 5% but keep in mind that you might go throught a HUGE shedding phase before getting those regrowth (it will basically get worse before it gets better) but you know that's how the hair cycle works. So a big shedding of your hair at the beginning of the treatment is actually a good thing (it shows the treatment is working). Everything you shed is gonna grown back thicker later !",

Like being in a hotel during a terrorist attack, being held captive in a store, going to a haunted house with my friends. It's a long story lol. But I think it was my mind's way of making sense of what was happening to me on the outside. Almost all of the dreams I was being forced to stay somewhere or stay in a situation that was terrifying. They had to zip tie me to the bed because when they tried to wake me up I was panicking and flailing. And I was fighting for survival in almost every instance of my dream. I wish I knew more about what happened. The doctors acted like I was an anomaly for having such intense coma dreams but I don't think it's rare after talking to other people who had similar experiences.",

Mine was from the anesthesia meds, lack of nutrients, and stress from the coma. Once I got out I started eating as healthy as possible and working out so the TE went away in a few months.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",

This is because women have always been shamed and put down if they spoke their mind and their opinion with some thing that men did not like. Women are very social beings so they don‚Äôt want to risk rejection, and they tend to be a lot more agreeable than men. Luckily I am a disagreeable woman and I speak my mind",

    "text": "My hair was falling out a few years ago... I did heavy detoxing, juicing, lots of raw fruits and vegetables, supplemented with real whole Irish Sea Moss, and Global Healing's Iodine, a whole food source of vitamin C, lots of sunshine.... my hair now grows twice as fast as anyone I know and it's so full as if I were 20 years old again. I believe the hair issue may be related to body detox pathways being backed up and not having the minerals and vitamins needed.",

    "text": "This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life. You can see older photos from some many decades ago or see how unfrequent balding was compared to nowadays.",
